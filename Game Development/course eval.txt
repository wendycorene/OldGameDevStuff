There was WAY too much group work.  Too much of my grade was dependent on if other people knew how to do the work/actually did the work.  I feel it is completely unfair that their inability to complete assignments effects whether or not I get a high enough grade in this course to keep my scholarships and stay in this program.

Working with other on so many project significantly stunted creativity.  People weren't willing to take risks while working with others.  I felt unable to take chances because I didn't want to look stupid to other people in the group.

There was a LOT of "mansplaining" by male students toward the female students any time any of them tried to contribute to class discussions.

Instructor is very poor at classroom management.  Students would frequently have side discussions during class or other student presentations.  It was incredibly distracting and rude and the professor would do nothing to stop it or prevent it.

The room set up was awful for class lectures and demos.
