I feel that Andrew really tried to get everyone together to work on the project, but it just didn't work well.  I don't feel like he did a lot on the project, though.  We had met the week the milestone project was due, and we each agreed to complete things, but he didn't work on it at all after we had met briefly in the library.

Devin and Connor were impossible to work with on this project.  They were difficult to get a hold of and didn't work on the project at all until March 8th or 9th.  They had asked us to do all the work for the milestone.  They have done work in the past few days, though.

I did a lot of work at the beginning of the project, but I have not done much at the end of the project.  I felt for my own mental health that I could no longer do the majority of the project and wanted to force the other guys to actually do work.  I also further recognized that educational group assignments are not fair to anyone.  My grade for an assignment, in a course, the ability to keep scholarships or stay in school should not be dependant on SOMEONE ELSE (which is exactly what this project does, since it is such a large part of our grade).

As of writing this (10PM, Sunday, March 10), there were 73 commits.  Wendy did 36 (49%), Andrew did 19 (26%), Devin did 11 (15%) and Connor did 7 (10%).  I don't know if this is an accurate way to sum up who did what, but I feel it's a measurable way to show something...
